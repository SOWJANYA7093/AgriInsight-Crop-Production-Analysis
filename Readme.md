# 🌾 AgriInsight – Crop Production Analysis (Project Samarth Submission)

## 🔍 Overview
**AgriInsight** is a data analytics prototype built for **Project Samarth (Build for Bharat Challenge)**.  
It analyzes India’s agricultural crop production data to uncover insights about:
- Which crops have the highest total production  
- Which seasons contribute most to yield  
- Which crops have the highest production efficiency (yield per area)

This project demonstrates how government open datasets can support informed agricultural decision-making.
